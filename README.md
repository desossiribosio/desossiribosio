# ðŸ‘‹ Hi
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a Mohole student studying **Graphics Design** and **Web & App development**.

ðŸŽ“ Currently, I'm in my second year of study at Mohole.

ðŸ’» I have a passion for technology and computer science, and I'm learning to create websites and applications for the web and mobile devices.

ðŸŽ¨ Additionally, I have skills in graphics and design, and I enjoy using them to create intuitive and elegant user interfaces for my projects.

Projects
