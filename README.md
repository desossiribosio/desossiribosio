# 👋 Hi
### Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a Mohole student studying **Graphics Design** and **Web & App development**.

🎓 Currently, I'm in my second year of study at Mohole.

💻 I have a passion for technology and computer science, and I'm learning to create websites and applications for the web and mobile devices.

🎨 Additionally, I have skills in graphics and design, and I enjoy using them to create intuitive and elegant user interfaces for my projects.

### 🧑‍🚀 Projects
In this repository, you'll find the projects I've created during my studies. Some of them have been developed in collaboration with other students, while others have been created individually.

🚀 Some of my recent projects include:
